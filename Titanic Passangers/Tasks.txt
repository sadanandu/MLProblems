Tasks
1. Take care of the missing data
-> We can handle missing data in multiple ways.
   a. Removing the records with missing data could be easiest option but that is not a good one as we lose data.
   b. Replacing missing data with some values. This is sometimes called imputing.
      We can replace missing value with either mean/median of the present values, value randomly selected from another record, value 
	  returned by another model. We can also use a default value depending on context. We have to remember that whatever logic we follow for imputing training
      data set, same logic needs to be followed for predicting/test dataset.
   
->Imputing or filling the missing data can be done in multiple ways
  a. Using Pandas DataFrame APIs
  b. Using sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer class
  

2. Handle categorical data
-> To handle categorical data we need to transform data to to enums. For that LableEncoder from sklearn can be used
   Since ML algorithms understand only numbers , they might consider enums in ascending or descending order, which would be wrong.
   Using OneHotEncoder which transforms a categorical independent variable into dummy variables.
   Thus making it useful in ML model.
   Categorical columns to be handled = Sex, pclass, Sibsp, Parch, Embarked
