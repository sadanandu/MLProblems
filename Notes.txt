Feature scaling:
Scaling ensures that just because some features are big it won't lead to using them as a main predictor.
MEthods:
Rescaling, mean normalization i.e. x= (x-mean(x))/max(x)-min(x)
standardization : x = (x- mean(x))/standard deviation(x)

classification vs regression
Both predict values
classification predicts discrete value or label whereas regression predicts continuous value. When classificaion algo
predicts a continuous value then it could be in the form of probability
skill of classification algo can be measured with accuracy
skill of regression algorithm can be measured with root mean squared error(RMSE)

Algorithms for classification
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
K Nearest Neighbors
Linear SVC (Support vector Classifier)

Regression Algorithms
Linear Regression
Regression Trees(e.g. Random Forest)
Support Vector Regression (SVR) 

Comparing classification algorithms
1. False Positive(Type 1 error telling a man that you are pregnant) and false negative(Type 2 error telling a pregnant woman that youare not pregnant)




Ensemble learning- Using multiple machine learning algorithms and create a parent algorithm to solve problems. e.g. Random Forest
Random forest runs decision tree algorithms multiple times
->For a randomly selected subset of data create a decision tree, repeat this multiple times.
->Pure performance with interpretability
