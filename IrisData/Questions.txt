Questions on IrisData problem

1.What are the common steps to follow when working on ML project?
-> 1. Data Preprocessing i.e. handling of missing/invalid data, converting categorical data i.e. data which can be divided into groups.
   2. Training model with training data
   3. Validating model with test data, improving the results by modifying the model
2.Common libraries required for ML project?

3.Pandas  DataFrame must know APIs
4. Plotting must know APIs
5.What is K-fold cross validation
   types of prediction error: Bias Error, Variance Error, Unreducible error
   Bias vs Variance  https://elitedatascience.com/bias-variance-tradeoff
   Underfitting vs Overfitting
   Cross validation
6. What is accuracy_score?
7. What is confusion matrix and how to interpret it?
8.What is Classification report?
9. Classification or regression?
  This should be the first step in machine learning.
  It needs to be decided whether you are dealing with an regression problem or classification problem.
  Depending on that models need to be decided. 
  
  Both predict values
classification predicts discrete value or label whereas regression predicts continuous value. When classificaion algo
predicts a continuous value then it could be in the form of probability
skill of classification algo can be measured with accuracy
skill of regression algorithm can be measured with root mean squared error(RMSE)

Algorithms for classification
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
K Nearest Neighbors
Linear SVC (Support vector Classifier)

Regression Algorithms
Linear Regression
Regression Trees(e.g. Random Forest)
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
